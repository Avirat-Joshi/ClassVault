# CAPSTONE PROJECT ::: ClassVault

This is our final capstone project of our first year PDS LAB
We have tried to make a game inspired from board game QUORIDOR 
using C language.

#### The Student management system - ClassVault is a software designed to track student information and academic records.<br>In today's digital age, the education industry continuously evolves. Efficient management systems are essential.<br>Creating a student management system involves addressing real-world challenges faced by institutes, such as data management, and             . <br><br>This is a project that demonstrates the working of an educational institute on an elementary level for people to understand. As you enter ClassVault you're asked to login where you have two options, login as 1. Teacher 2.Student.After authentication, you're allowed to use facilities like add, edit, view, remove, search, and group the students and the teachers. Students can give their feedback about teachers.<br> Furthermore Teachers can see feedback from students for improvement in their teaching. There is also a grading system in our application that assigns grades and CGPA to students according to their marks.

## Stand out Features
### -**Merge sort**: We used the mergesort algorithm for sorting which reduces time complexity to O(n logn).
### -**rand() and Seed**: We used the rand() function while generating the password and the Srand function ensures that the random number generator is seeded with the current time, providing a different seed for each run of the program.
### - **CSV File**: We used the CSV file instead of text for making the database.
###    **Benefits of using a CSV file** :
####      -**Simplicity** 
####      -**Well-structured** 
####      -**Compatibility** 
####      -**Efficiency** 
####      -**Flexibility**
